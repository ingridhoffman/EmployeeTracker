Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

- Add departments, roles, employees

- Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

- Update employee managers

- View employees by manager

- Delete departments, roles, and employees

- View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

- Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

- You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

### Hints

- Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.
